    'long_description': '# Auri - Nanoleaf Aurora CLI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MrTrustworthy/auri.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MrTrustworthy/auri)\n\nA simple, light-weight tool for controlling multiple Aurora devices from the CLI. Supports the most important functionality of the Nanoleaf app (registering new devices, switching effects, changing brightness, on/off,...) as well as an Ambilight feature that is based on the colors of your main display.\n\n\n## Usage \n\n### Installation\n\nAs it\'s a Python3-based application, you can install the CLI simply via `pip`. `pip install auri` or `python3 -m pip install auri` (if your default pip is for Python2) are both acceptable ways of installing.\n\n### Device Setup\n\nTo find and generate credentials for the Nanoleaf Aurora device in your home, make sure your PC/Laptop is in the same network and run `auri device setup`. Auri will then guide you through the setup for each device it can find.\n\nYou can give each device a name and switch the currently active device by running `auri device activate <device name>`. In general, all commands will only affect the currently active device. If you want a command to apply to a different device, either activate it or target a specific device via adding `-a <device name>` to you command.\n\n### Basic functionality\n\nSwitching effects is done via `auri effects`, like `auri effects play rain`. There is a best-effort spelling correction to find the effect you meant even if you mistype or only type a part of the effect name.\n\nSwitching brightness and other simple values can be done via ex. `auri effects set brightness 50`. To get the current values, simply use `get` instead of `set`.\n\nThe effect list uses terminal colors to show a preview of the effect colors, so `auri effects list` will show you something like this:\n\n![auri_effect_list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrTrustworthy/auri/master/auri_effect_list_terminal.png)\n\n### Ambilight\n\nThere is a built-in ambilight functionality that is based on your primary display. Use `auri effects ambi` to start a blocking shell that will update the effect each seconds. It needs to create a new effect on the device to do so, which will be called `AuriAmbi` so you know what it is.\n\nYou can customize the behaviour of the ambilight, just use `auri effects ambi --help` to see which parameters you can play with, though the default settings work quite nice.\n\nThe Ambilight functionality only works on MacOS and Windows (untested), but not on Linux due to the dependency on `ImageGrab`. If you\'re using Linux and know of a way to get this working, feel free to shoot me a PR.\n\n### Alfred Integration\n\nIf you\'re on MacOS, you can also use this CLI to easily build a [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow to change effects. Simply run `auri device images` to generate some preview images for all your effects, then create a simple workflow that has `auri alfred prompt` as a script filter and pipes the result to `auri alfred command` as a "run script" action.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIn case you want new features, feel free to implement them and shoot me a PR. The codebase is small and pretty easy to understand, and in case you\'re missing a feature it\'s probably not because it\'s hard to implement but because I didn\'t think of it.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nSome of the code has been (in altered form) taken from [Anthony Brians GitHub Project "Nanoleaf"](https://github.com/software-2/nanoleaf). Thanks for figuring out the device discovery Anthony!\n',
