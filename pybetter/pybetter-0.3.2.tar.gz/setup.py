Both of those forms are compiled to the same bytecode, but second form has some potential of confusion for the reader. \n\n  ```python\n  # BEFORE:\n  if not 42 in counts:\n      sys.exit(-1)\n  \n  # AFTER:\n  if 42 not in counts:\n      sys.exit(-1)\n  ```\n\n  \n\n* **B002: Default values for `kwargs` are mutable.**\n\n  As described in [Common Gotchas](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/#mutable-default-arguments) section of "The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to Python", mutable arguments can be a tricky thing. This fixer replaces any default values that happen to be lists or dicts with **None** value, moving initialization from function definition into function body.\n\n  ```python\n  # BEFORE\n  def p(a=[]):\n      print(a)\n    \n  # AFTER\n  def p(a=None):\n      if a is None:\n          a = []\n      \n      print(a)\n  ```\n\n  Be warned, that this fix may break code which *intentionally* uses mutable default arguments (e.g. caching).\n\n* **B003: Remove parentheses from the tuple in \'return\' statement.**\n\n  If you are returning a tuple from the function by implicitly constructing it, then additional parentheses around it are redundant.\n\n  ```python\n  # BEFORE:\n  def hello():\n      return ("World", 42)\n  \n  # AFTER:\n  def hello():\n      return "World", 42\n  ```\n\n* **B004: `__all__` attribute is missing.**\n\n  Regenerate missing `__all__` attribute, filling it with the list of top-level function and class names.\n\n  *NB*: It will ignore any names starting with `_` to prevent any private members from ending up in the list.\n  \n  ```python\n  # BEFORE:\n  def hello():\n      return ("World", 42)\n  \n  class F:\n      pass\n  \n  # AFTER:\n  def hello():\n      return "World", 42\n  \n  class F:\n      pass\n  \n  __all__ = [\n    "F",\n    "hello",\n  ]\n  ```\n  \n* **B005: Replace "A == None" with "A is None"**\n\n  "Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with `is` or `is not`, never the equality operators." ([PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/))\n\n  ```python\n  # BEFORE:\n  \n  if a == None:\n      pass\n    \n  # AFTER:\n  \n  if a is None:\n      pass\n  ```\n  \n* **B006: Remove comparisons with either \'False\' or \'True\'.**\n\n  [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) recommends that conditions should be evaluated without explicit equality comparison with `True`/`False` singletons. In Python, every non-empty value is treated as `True` and vice versa,\n\n  so in most cases those comparisons can be safely eliminated.\n\n  *NB*: `is True` and `is False` checks are not affected, since they can be used to explicitly check for equality with a specific singleton, instead of using abovementioned "non-empty" heuristic.\n\n  ```python\n  # BEFORE:\n  \n  if a == False or b == True or c == False == True:\n      pass\n    \n  # AFTER:\n  \n  if a or b or c:\n      pass\n  \n  ```\n  \n* **B007: Convert f-strings without expressions into regular strings.**\n\n  It is wasteful to use f-string mechanism if there are no expressions to be extrapolated. \n\n  ```python\n  # BEFORE:\n  a = f"Hello, world"\n  \n  # AFTER:\n  a = "Hello, world"\n  ```\n\n\n\n**NB:** Each of the fixers can be disabled on per-line basis using [flake8\'s "noqa" comments](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/3.1.1/user/ignoring-errors.html#in-line-ignoring-errors).\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell script\n# pip install pybetter\n```\n\n## Getting started with development\n\n```shell script\n# git clone https://github.com/lensvol/pybetter\n# poetry install\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details\n\n## Authors\n\n* **Kirill Borisov** ([lensvol@gmail.com](mailto:lensvol@gmail.com))\n',
