    """
    Function decorator that attempts to retry the wrapped function a fixed number of times, with exponential backoff.

    Usage:
        @retry_with_backoff(retries=3, delay=5, backoff=2, logger=None)
        def service_request():
            # function logic that may raise an exception, but may
            # return a successful response subsequently

    The above example will retry the function `service_request()` 3 times, at intervals of 5 sec, 10 sec, 20 sec

    Currently a retry will be done for *any* exception thrown. However, as per need, this can be easily extended to
    handle only a specific set of exceptions and pass/raise the others.

    Note: Make sure the exceptions don't contain PII, or in other words, you're in control of the logger.
