class GapSequence(BedSequence):
    """
    Keras Sequence that returns tuples of nucleotide sequences,
    one with synthetic gaps and the other without as ground truth.

    Usage examples
    -------------------------
    To use GapSequence to train your keras model you
    will need to obtain statistical metrics for the
    biological gaps you intend to mimic in your synthetic gaps.

    To achieve this, this package offers an utility called
    get_gaps_statistics, which allows you to obtain the
    mean and covariance of gaps in a given genomic assembly.

    The genomic assembly is automatically downloaded from UCSC
    using `ucsc_genomes_downloader <https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/ucsc_genomes_downloader>`__,
    then the gaps contained within are extracted and their windows
    is expanded to the given one, after filtering for the given
    max_gap_size, as you might want to limit the gaps size to
    a relatively small one (gaps can get in the tens of thousands
    of nucleotides, for instance in the telomeres).

    Let's start by listing all the important parameters:

    .. code:: python

        assembly = "hg19"
        window_size = 200
        batch_size = 128

    Now we can start by retrieving the gaps statistics:

    .. code:: python

        from keras_synthetic_genome_sequence.utils import get_gaps_statistics

        number, mean, covariance = get_gaps_statistics(
            assembly=assembly,
            max_gap_size=100,
            window_size=window_size
        )

        print("I have identified {number} gaps!".format(number=number))

    Now you must choose the ground truth on which to apply the
    synthetic gaps, for instance the regions without gaps in
    the genomic assembly hg19, chromosome chr1.
    These regions will have to be tasselized into smaller
    chunks that are compatible with the shape you have chosen for
    the gap statistics window_size.
    We can retrieve these regions as follows:

    .. code:: python

        from ucsc_genomes_downloader import Genome
        from ucsc_genomes_downloader.utils import tasselize_bed

        hg19 = Genome(assembly, chromosomes=["chr1"])
        ground_truth = tasselize_bed(genome.filled(), window_size=window_size)

    The obtained pandas DataFrame will have a bed-like format
    and look as follows:

    +----+---------+--------------+------------+
    |    | chrom   |   chromStart |   chromEnd |
    +====+=========+==============+============+
    |  0 | chr1    |        10000 |      10200 |
    +----+---------+--------------+------------+
    |  1 | chr1    |        10200 |      10400 |
    +----+---------+--------------+------------+
    |  2 | chr1    |        10400 |      10600 |
    +----+---------+--------------+------------+
    |  3 | chr1    |        10600 |      10800 |
    +----+---------+--------------+------------+
    |  4 | chr1    |        10800 |      11000 |
    +----+---------+--------------+------------+

    Now we are ready to actually create the GapSequence:

    .. code:: python

        from keras_synthetic_genome_sequence import GapSequence

        gap_sequence = GapSequence(
            assembly=assembly,
            ground_truth,
            gaps_mean=mean,
            gaps_covariance=covariance,
            batch_size=batch_size
        )

    Now, having a model that receives as
    input and output shape (batch_size, window_size, 4),
    we can train it as follows:

    .. code:: python

        model = build_my_denoiser()
        model.fit_generator(
            gap_sequence,
            steps_per_epoch=gap_sequence.steps_per_epoch,
            epochs=2,
            shuffle=True
        )

    Happy denoising!
