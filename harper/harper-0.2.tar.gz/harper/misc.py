    """Pass through an iterable and return certain windowed segments.

    It's basically a moving window of a certain size and stride
    that extracts subsets of an iiterable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iterable : iter
        The thing to move through
    size: int
        The size of the window to pan with. This is how many
        elements will be considered as part of a subset.
    stride: int
        After getting a subgset, how many steps should the window
        move before selecting the next chunk?
    unequal : str
        Can be 'pad' or 'drop'. It's very possible that the 
        end of a list wont contain the expected number of items,
        eg. 
        [1,2,3]
        with a size of 4 would only find 3 elements. What should happen?
        If 'pad' we add a value to that subset. Specify the value with the
        padval keyword argument. If 'drop' we simply let the subset be 
        3 items.


    Examples
    --------
    orig = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
    window(orig, size=2, stride=3)

      -> [(1,2),3,4,5,6,7,8]
      -> [1,2,3,(4,5),6,7,8]
      -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,(7,8)]

    would return [[1,2], [4,5], [7,8]]
