    so the base code becomes more readable and straightforward.

    To understand the S3 structure, you need to know it is not a hierarchical filesystem,
    it is only a key-value store, though the key is often used like a file path for organising data,
    prefix + filename.
    More information about this can be read in this StackOverFlow thread:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52443839/s3-what-exactly-is-a-prefix-and-what-ratelimits-apply

    All that means is that while you may see a path as:
    s3://bucket-1/folder1/subfolder1/some_file.csv
    root| folder | sub.1 |  sub.2   |    file    |

    It is actually:
    s3://bucket-1/folder1/sub1/file.csv
    root| bucket |         key        |

    A great (not directly related) thread that can help that sink in (and help understand some methods here)
    is this one: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35803027/retrieving-subfolders-names-in-s3-bucket-from-boto3

    In this class, all keys and keys prefix are being treated as a folder tree structure,
    since the reason for this to exists is to make the programmers interactions with S3
    easier to write and the code easier to read."""
