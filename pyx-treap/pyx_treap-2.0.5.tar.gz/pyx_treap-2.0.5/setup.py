A set of python modules implementing treaps is provided.

Treaps perform most operations in O(log2(n)) time, and are innately sorted.
They're very nice for keeping a collection of values that needs to
always be sorted, or for optimization problems in which you need to find
the p best values out of q, when p is much smaller than q.

A module is provided for treaps that enforce uniqueness.

A pure python version is included, as is a Cython-enhanced version for performance.
