## Purpose

The purpose of BASIC Wrangler is to allow you to write BASIC programs using labels in a dialect-agnostic way. It also combines and crunches lines to take up the least amount of space on output, thus saving you memory. It is designed to be able to work with almost any dialect of line numbered BASIC.

## Installation

To install with pip, type:

```Batchfile
pip install basic-wrangler
```

## Basic Usage

To load the GUI, type `bw` (a harmless console window might open up behind the main window -- ignore it). Type `bw -h` for CLI help. For more, download [the PDF Manual zip file at the release page](https://github.com/pahandav/basic-wrangler/releases).
