def calculate_reaction_energy(reaction, compound_energies):
    r""" Calculates the formation energy of a compound per formula unit

    Parameters
    ----------
    reaction : dict of lists of tuples
        Describes the reaction that will be calculated.
        The dictionary keys are 'reactants' and 'products'.
        The value of 'reactants' is a list with tuples.
        Each tuple contains the FORMULA UNIT of the reactants
        and the number of moles for that reactant in the reaction.
        The value of 'products' is analogous, but for the products.

        The compounds specified in :data:`reaction` will be taken as
        the formula units in calculating the reaction.


    compound_energies : dict of lists
        Analogous structure as in :data:`reaction`, but instead of the number
        of moles, the values are the calculated energies.

        Note:
            the order of the compounds in each list has to match
            that in :data:`reaction`!

        E.g. we calculated the energies of 'Mn2' (bcc Mn cell), 'O2'
        and 'Mn32O48' (Pbca space group)
        Then we would have:

        >>> compound_energies = {
                                  'reactants' : [('Mn2',E1), ('O2', E2)],
                                  'products'  : [('Mn32O48', E3)]
                                 }

    Returns
    -------
    energy : float
        The energy of the reaction specified in :data:`reaction`

    Examples
    --------
    Suppose one is interested in the reaction:

    .. math::

        2\mathrm{Mn} + 3/2 \mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow
        \mathrm{Mn}_2\mathrm{O}_3

    And one has calculated the energy of Mn2 (bcc cell) and stored it in
    the variable ``E1``, the energy of O2 is stored in ``E2``
    and that of Mn2O3 in ``E3``.
    Then to calculate the reaction energy one can use:

    >>> reaction = {
                    'reactants' : [('Mn', 2), ('O2',3/2)],
                    'products'  : [('Mn2O3', 1)]
                   }
    >>> compound_energies = {
                             'reactants' : [('Mn2', E1), ('O2', E2)],
                             'products'  : [('Mn2O3', E3)]}
