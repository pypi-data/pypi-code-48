Modify the resulting docx, applying the following changes:\n\t- Add title page + empty page (usually the second page is empty)\n\t- Maybe add extra pages such as index or dedication\n\t- Add page numbering (make sure to make it start only after the special pages such as index/dedication)\n\t- Make sure that every new chaper is in an odd page (this is to make it so that the first page of every chaper appears on the left)\n\t- Make the total number of pages a multiple of 4 (if it's not, empty pages will be added at the end to pad it)\n\t- It's recommended to set the size of the document to A5 and use generous margins\n3. Export the document into a pdf (we will refer to this pdf as `formatted.pdf`)\n\n**Note**: You can use [this docx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corollari/bookify/master/book.docx) as a template and/or example of the book layout described.\n\n## Build book\n### Install pdfjam\n```\nsudo apt-get install pdfjam # Ubuntu\nsudo dnf install texlive-pdfjam-bin # Fedora\n```\n\n### Build\n```\npip install bookify\nbookify formatted.pdf 20\n```\n**Usage**: First argument (`formatted.pdf`) is the name of the pdf and second argument (`20`) is the signature size, that is, the number of pages per booklet\n\n## Extra: Getting books from wattpad\n```\npip install FanFicFare\nfanficfare https://www.wattpad.com/story/9999999-story-title\n```\nUse URLs like:\n * https://www.wattpad.com/story/9999999-story-title\n * https://www.wattpad.com/story/9999999\n * https://www.wattpad.com/9999999-chapter-is-ok-too\n",
