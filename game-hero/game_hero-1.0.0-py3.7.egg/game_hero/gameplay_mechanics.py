"""
Mechanics of the HeroGame gameplay.

The playable character, called Orderus, has some strengths and weaknesses,
as all heroes have.
After battling all kinds of monsters for more than a hundred years,
Orderus now has the following stats:

- Health: 70 - 100
- Strength: 70 - 80
- Defence: 45 – 55
- Speed: 40 – 50
- Luck: 10% - 30% (0% means no luck, 100% lucky all the time).
Also, he possesses 2 skills:

- Rapid strike: Strike twice while it’s his turn to attack;
(there’s a 10% chance he’ll use this skill every time he attacks)
- Magic shield: Takes only half of the usual damage when an enemy attacks;
(there’s a 20% change he’ll use this skill every time he defends.)

Gameplay

Orderus encounters a wild beast, with the following properties:

- Health: 60 - 90
- Strength: 60 - 90
- Defence: 40 – 60
- Speed: 40 – 60
- Luck: 25% - 40%

The game simulates a battle between Orderus and a wild beast,
taking into consideration that, in every battle,
Orderus and the beast must be initialized with random properties (within range)

The first attack is done by the player with the higher speed.
If both players have the same speed,
then the attack is carried on by the player with the highest luck.
After an attack, the players switch roles:
the attacker now defends and the defender now attacks.

The damage done by the attacker is calculated with the following formula:
Damage = Attacker strength – Defender defence

The damage is subtracted from the defender’s health.
An attacker can miss their hit and do no damage if the defender gets lucky.
Orderus’ skills occur randomly, based on their chances on each turn

Game over

The game ends when one of the players remain without health
or the number of turns reaches 20.
The application outputs the results for each turn: what happened,
which skills were used (if any), the damage done, defender’s health left.
Additionally, if there's a winner before the maximum number of rounds,
it'll be declared.
