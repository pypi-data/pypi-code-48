Motivation
----------

Geometry-based MIMO channel modelling and a high-resolution parameter
estimation are applications in which a precise description of the radiation
pattern of the antenna arrays is required. In this package we implement an
efficient representation of the polarimetric antenna response, which we refer
to as the Effective Aperture Distribution Function (EADF). High-resolution
parameter estimation are applications in which this reduced description permits
us to efficiently interpolate the beam pattern to gather the antenna response
for an arbitrary direction in azimuth and elevation. Moreover, the EADF
provides a continuous description of the array manifold and its derivatives
with respect to azimuth and elevation. The latter is valuable for the
performance evaluation of an antenna array as well as for gradient-based
parameter estimation techniques.

Features
--------

This package allows to **import** measurement data that represents beam
patterns of antenna arrays, you can **export** these to a more convenient
format. It handles **interpolation** along the frequencies the antenna array
was excited with and can also deal with irregularly sampled beampatterns,
so it can **interpolate** along azimuth and co-elevation. Moreover one can
**compress** beampatterns by truncating their representation in the spatial
Fourier domain.

Performance
-----------

Since this package is mainly for academic purposes, we do not aim at the
highest level of optimization. Instead we try to provide clean, readable and
nicely structured code. Algorithmic optimizations are always welcome, if
they are sufficiently motivated and documented in the implementation or
some publication.

Intel Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Moreover we have found out that for most purposes it is sufficient to just use
the `Intel Python Distribution
<https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python>`_,
which can be installed and used alongside any conventional CPython
distribution. It is automatically optimized for modern CPU instruction sets.
For instance Numpy operations are implemented using SIMD and SMP,
which would require a huge manual effort to replicate.
For example putting the following into a file

>>> import eadf.arrays
>>> import eadf.core
>>> A = eadf.arrays.generateStackedUCA(11, 3, 1.5, 0.5)
>>> arrAzi, arrEle = eadf.core.toGrid(
>>>     *eadf.core.sampleAngles(240, 120)
>>> )
>>> A.pattern(arrAzi, arrEle, 1)

and changing nothing but the Python executable, yields the following:

>>> [user@pc EADF]$ time python/intelpython3 profiler.py
>>> real	0m51,424s/0m6,250s
>>> user	0m49,874s/0m8,469s
>>> sys	    0m0,485s/0m2,842s

Note that in this example we evaluate the beampattern at 28800 distinct
angular locations. (YMMV)

CuPy
^^^^

Cupy is a very nice reimplementation of the numpy API but for CUDA enabled
graphics chips. So it works as a drop-in replacement for numpy in our core
routines as soon as you enable it. So, install cupy for your currently
installed CUDA version and easily get going with your graphics chip. Again,
as above, your mileage may vary.

>>> import eadf.arrays
>>> import eadf.core
>>> import timeit
>>> A = eadf.arrays.generateStackedUCA(11, 3, 1.5, 0.5)
>>> arrAzi, arrEle = eadf.core.toGrid(
>>>     *eadf.core.sampleAngles(240, 120)
>>> )
>>> A.useGPU = True
>>> def B():
>>>     A.pattern(arrAzi, arrEle, 1)
>>> print(timeit.timeit(B, number=3)/3)
