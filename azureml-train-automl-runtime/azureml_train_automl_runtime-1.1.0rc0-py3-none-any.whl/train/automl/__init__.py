"""
Contains functionality representing core automated ML and runtime components in Azure Machine Learning.

The *azureml-train-automl-runtime* package contains functionality for automatically finding the best machine learning
model and its parameters, given training and test data. 

The runtime package contains functionality to run training in pipelines as well as create advanced training logic
with ensembles. The runtime package has dependencies on other packages such as *pandas*, *numpy*, or *scikit-learn*.

The related *azureml-train-automl-client* package can be used for interactively submitting automate ML experiments,
and is is a lighterweight package with fewer dependencies.

For more information about automated ML in Azure, see [What is automated machine
learning?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-automated-ml)
