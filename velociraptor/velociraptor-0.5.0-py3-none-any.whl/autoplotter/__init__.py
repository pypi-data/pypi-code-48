"""
Autoplotter module. Contains the functionality to use the library
to automatically make plots of variable x against variable y, by
reading from a yaml file.

This yaml file has the following format:

.. code-block:: yaml

   output_filename:
     # Global plot quantities
     type: scatter / histogram / 2dhistogram / massfunction
     select_structure_type: number of substructure to select (e.g. 10 is centrals)
     number_of_bins: number of bins in the (background) histogram or massfunc
     # Horizontal quantity
     x:
       quantity: "quantity.name" (e.g. masses.mass_200crit)
       units: units to plot in (e.g. Solar_Mass)
       start: horizontal axis start (in units above)
       end: horizontal axis to end (in units above)
       log: true/false (true by default), do you want a log axis?
       label_override: override the label with your own choice
       # if hist or massfunc, in units above
       start_bin: number to start binning at (default is start)
       end_bin: number to end binning at (default is end)
     # Vertical quantity - only need units for massfunction
     y:
       quantity: "quantity.name" (e.g. masses.mass_200crit)
       units: units to plot in (e.g. Solar_Mass)
       start: vertical axis start (in units above)
       end: vertical axis to end (in units above)
       log: true/false (true by default), do you want a log axis?
       label_override: override the label with your own choice
     # Lines that you can plot on top - line_type can be median or mean
     line_type: 
       plot: true/false (true by default) actually plot this?
       log: true/false (true by default) use log bins?
       show_scatter: true/false (true by default) show scatter, or just plot line?
       number_of_bins: number of bins for median line, different from number_of_bins above
       start: value to start binning at
         value: start value
         units: start value units
       end:
         value: end value
         units: end value units
     # Generic metadata for plot
     metadata:
       title: title for the plot, should you want one
     # Comparison data to plot on top
     observational_data:
       - filename: filename of data to plot on this plot (use ObservationalData written to disk)
       - filename: second filename for observational data
       - filename: ... you can plot as many of these as you'd like
