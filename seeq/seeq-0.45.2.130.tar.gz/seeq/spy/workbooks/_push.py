    """
    Pushed workbooks into Seeq using a list of Workbook object definitions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    workbooks : {Workbook, list[Workbook]}
        A Workbook object or list of Workbook objects to be pushed into Seeq.

    path : str, default None
        A '>>'-delimited folder path to create to contain the workbooks. Note
        that a further subfolder hierarchy will be created to preserve the
        relative paths that the folders were in when they were searched for
        and pulled. If you specify None, then the workbook will stay where
        it is (if it has already been pushed once). If you specify a zero-
        length string or spy.PATH_ROOT, it will be moved to the root.

    owner : str, default None
        Determines the ownership of pushed workbooks and folders.

        By default, the current owner will be preserved. If the content doesn't
        exist yet, the logged-in user will be the owner.

        All other options require that the logged-in user is an admin:

        If spy.workbooks.ORIGINAL_OWNER, ownership is assigned according to the
        original owner of the pulled content.

        If spy.workbooks.FORCE_ME_AS_OWNER, existing content will be
        reassigned to the logged-in user.

        If a username or a user's Seeq ID is supplied, that user will be
        assigned as owner.

        You may need to supply an appropriate datasource map if the usernames
        are different between the original and the target servers.

    label : str
        A user-defined label that differentiates this push operation from
        others. By default, the label will be the logged-in user's username
        OR the username from the 'owner' argument so that push activity will
        generally be isolated by user. But you can override this with a label
        of your choosing.

    datasource_map_folder : str, default None
        A folder containing Datasource_Map_Xxxx_Yyyy_Zzzz.json files that can
        provides a means to map stored items (i.e., those originating from
        external datasources like OSIsoft PI) from one server to another or
        from one datasource to another (i.e., for workbook swapping). A default
        set of datasource map files is created during a pull/save sequence, and
        you can copy these default files to a folder, alter them, and then
        specify the folder as this argument.


    use_full_path : bool, default False
        If True, the original full path for an item is reconstructed, as
        opposed to the path that is relative to the Path property supplied to
        the spy.workbooks.search() call that originally helped create these
        workbook definitions. Note that this full path will still be inside
        the folder specified by the 'path' argument, if supplied.

    access_control : str, default None
        Specifies how Access Control Lists should be treated, via the
        following keywords: add/replace,loose/strict

        If None, then no access control entries are pushed.
        If 'add', then existing access control entries will not be disturbed
          but new entries will be added.
        If 'replace', then existing access control entries will be removed
          and replaced with the entries from workbook definitions.

        If 'loose', then any unmapped users/groups from the workbook
          definitions will be silently ignored.
        If 'strict', then any unmapped users/groups will result in errors.

        Example: access_control='replace,loose'

    override_max_interp : bool, default False
        If True, then the Maximum Interpolation overrides from the source
        system will be written to the destination system.

    include_inventory : bool, default True
        If True, then all calculated items that are scoped to the workbook
        will be pushed as well.

    scope_globals_to_workbook : bool, default False
        If include_inventory=True and scope_globals_to_workbook=True, then
        all globally-scoped (aka "Available outside this analysis") items
        will be scoped to the workbook. False if you want to actually push
        these items to the global scope.

    refresh : bool, default True
        If True, then the Workbook objects that were supplied as input will
        be updated to be "fresh" from the server after the push. All
        identifiers will reflect the actual pushed IDs. Since refreshing
        takes time, you can set this to False if you don't plan to make
        further modifications to the Workbook objects or use the new IDs.

    errors : {'raise', 'catalog'}, default 'raise'
        If 'raise', any errors encountered will cause an exception. If
        'catalog', errors will be added to a 'Result' column in the status.df
        DataFrame (errors='catalog' must be combined with
        status=<Status object>).

    quiet : bool
        If True, suppresses progress output.

    status : spy.Status
        If supplied, this Status object will be updated as the command
        progresses.
